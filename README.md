# red

red or the RustyEditor is a lightweight and minimal text editor which supports multiple-tabs (Ã  la vscode) and which integrates a file browser and a terminal. The editor component supports syntax highlighting via [tree-sitter-highlight](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/highlight).

The terminal itself is quite minimal, supports a limited subset of ansi escape sequences (don't expect to run vim in it!), and is powered by [portable-pty](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pty).

git clone https://github.com/MoAlyousef/red
